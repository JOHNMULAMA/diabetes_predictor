# diabetes_predictor
This code uses the pandas library to load the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from a URL, splits the dataset into input features (X) and target variable (y), trains a logistic regression model on the data using the LogisticRegression class from scikit-learn, and saves the trained model to a file named diabetes_model.pkl using the pickle module. Note that you will need an internet connection to load the dataset from the URL.
